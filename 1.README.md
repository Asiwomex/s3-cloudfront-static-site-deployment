# Continuous Deployment of Static Website to Amazon S3 and CloudFront

- Hosting a static website using S3 and Cloudfront
- Automation Process/ Workflow Method

## Creating S3 and Uploading the Static Website

1. First, Open the S3 on the AWS console and create a new S3 Bucket 
2. create an S3 bucket and name it say, "dev.auroraverusschool.org" always good to name the S3 after the domain name you want to use
3. Enable ACLs in bucket creation (ACLs enabled) under the Object Ownership
4. Uncheck the "Block all public access" and check the acknowledgement check box
5. Enable bucket Versioning
6. Click Create Bucket
7. when bucket is created, select the created bucket by clicking on it
8. Policies
	1. Go to permissions, Policies and open the Policy generator
	2. Under type of Policy, select "S3 bucket Policy"
	3. Put * for the Principal section
	4. Under Actions, select GetObject only
	5. Under Amazon Resource Name (ARN), copy your bucket ARN at where the bucket policy and come paste in there and add `/*` (forward slash all) to it
	6. add statement and generate policy, 
	7. copy, and paste in the policy and save
9. Go to properties and enable static website hosting at the very end of the section, under "Static Website Hosting"
	1. default index is index.html
	2. save changes
10. now if you visit the bucket link just at the "Static Website Hosting" it will say key not found
11. now go back to the jobs file, the main.yaml file
	1. make sure you are in your own branch, I repeat, make sure you are in your own branch, else create your branch and all works should be pushed to the created to that branch and do not merge to main but to the "dev" branch
	2. under "run", change the "s3 bucket link" to the name of the bucket that has been created which is "dev.auroraverusschool.org"
	3. rename all sections of the job in the yaml file to the name of the branch to which the code will be pushed to, which is "dev"

## Creating Cloudfront Distribution

12. Create a Cloudfront Distribution
	1. Open Cloundfront from the AWS console
	2. Select "create distribution"
	3. origin : select the bucket that you just created, this one starts with the "dev.auroraverusschool.org.s3"
	4. it's a website so select HTTP
	5. under Web Application Firewall (WAF), select "Do not enable security protections"
	6. leave everything else as it is and create the distribution
	7. copy the distribution ID, written big and boldly at the top and paste it in the "distribution ID" section under the "run" command of you jobs, in the main.yaml file
13. edit or make some additions in the index.html file
14. save
15. now add using `git add .`
16. then commit using `git commit -m "comment"`
17. then push using `git push`
18. Now when it is pushed, GO TO GITHUB
	1. create the pull request
	2. compare your branch to the "dev" branch
	3. create the pull request
	4. merge
	5. check the actions to see the kind of job it will pick
	6. it should skip any other job that is not related to the "dev"
19. Now check the S3 bucket and everything should be deployed
20. Create an alternative domain which is the "dev.auroraverusschool.org"
	1. go back to cloudfront
	2. Under "General", go to "Settings" and select "Edit"
	3. under "Alternative domain name", type "dev.auroraverusschool.org"
	4. under "Custom SSL certificate", choose the already created certificate "auroraverusschool.org" certificate
	5. leave the rest as it is and save changes
21. Now you have to redirect all traffic from HTTP to HTTPS
	1. still in the cloudfront, go to "Behaviours" section
	2. select or tick your distribution and select "Edit"
	3. change "HTTP and HTTPS" to "Redirect HTTP to HTTPs"
	4. save changes
22. now go to dev.auroraverusshcool.org and realise it is serving properly
23. Open Route 53
	1. check if the record is hitting the right Cloudfront Endpoint, if not, create one or make sure it is
	2. if editing or creating, select and edit or create one
	3. in the "Record name"section, put "dev" because the ".auroraverusschool.org" is already written for you
	4. check on the "Alias"
	5. "Route traffic to": select "Alias to Cloudfront Distribution"
	6. save and refresh
24. now you can open the devs.auroraverusschool.org, everything should work fine
